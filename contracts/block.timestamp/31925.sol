/**
 * Savings is a contract that releases Tokens on a predefined

 * proportional basis, determined by the ratio of deposited tokens
 * to total owned tokens.
 *
 * The distribution schedule consists of a monthly withdrawal schedule
 * responsible for distribution 75% of the total savings, and a
 * one-off withdrawal event available before or at the start of the
 * withdrawal schedule, distributing 25% of the total savings.
 *
 * To be exact, upon contract deployment there may be a period of time in which
 * only the one-off withdrawal event is available, define this period of time as:
 * [timestamp(start), timestamp(startBlockTimestamp)),
 *
 * Then the periodic withdrawal range is defined as:
 * [timestamp(startBlockTimestamp), +inf)
 *
 * DO NOT SEND TOKENS TO THIS CONTRACT. Use the deposit() or depositTo() method.
 * As an exception, tokens transferred to this contract before locking are the
 * bonus tokens that are distributed.
