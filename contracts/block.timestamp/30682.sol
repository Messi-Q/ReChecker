 * V 1.0. 
 * (C) profit-chain.net Licensed under MIT terms
 *
 * ProfitChain is a game allowing participants to win some Ether. Based on Ethereum intrinsic randomness and difficulty, you must be either lucky or one
 * hell of a hacker to win... Read the code, and if you find a problem, write owner AT profit-chain.net !
 *
 * Investors participate in rounds of fixed size and investment. Once a round is full, a new one opens automatically.
 * A single winner is picked per round, raking all the round's investments (minus invitor fees).
 *
 * Each investor must provide an invitor address when making the first investment in the group.
 * The game includes a time and depth limited invitation pyramid - you must invest first, then you can invite others. As invitor you'll enjoy a part of invitees investment
 * and wins, as well as their sub-invitees, for a limited time, and up to certain number of generations.
 *
 * There are multiple groups, each with its specific characteristics- to cater to all players.
 * 
 * We deter hacking of the winner by making it non-economical:
 * There is a "security factor" K, which is larger than the group round size N.
 * For example, for N=10 we may choose K=50.
 * A few blocks following the round's last investment, the winner is picked if the block's hash mod K is a number of 1...N.
 * If a hacker miner made a single invetment in the round, the miner would have to match 1 out of 50 "guesses", ie. 50 times greater effort than usual...
 * If a hacker miner made all invetments but one in the round, the miner would have to match 9 of of 50 "guesses", or about 5 times greater than usual...
 * And then there's the participation fees, that render even that last scenario non-economical.
 *
 * It would take a little over K blocks on average to declare the winner.
 * At 15 seconds per block, if K=50, it would take on average 13 minutes after the last investment, before a winner is found.
 * BUT! 
 * Winner declaration is temporary - checking is done on last 255 blocks. So even if a winner exists now, the winner must be actively named using a transaction while relevant.
 * A "checkAndDeclareWinner" transaction is required to write the winner (at the time of the transaction!) into the blockchain.
 * 
 * All Ether withdrawals, after wins or invitor fees payouts, require execution of a "withdraw" transaction, for safety.
