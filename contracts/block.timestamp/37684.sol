/// Cillionaire is a lottery where people can participate until a pot limit is reached. Then, a random participant is chosen to be the winner.
/// 
/// Randomness is achieved by XOR'ing the following two numbers:
/// ownerRandomNumber ... a random number supplied by the contract owner and submitted upon `start` as a hash, much like a concealed bid in an auction.
/// minerRandomNumber ... timestamp of the block that contains the last participant's `particpate` transaction.
/// Neither can the owner know the minerRandomNumber, nor can the miner know the ownerRandomNumber (unless the owner supplies a breakable hash, e.h. keccak256(1)).
///
/// Many safeguards are in place to prevent loss of participants' stakes and ensure fairness:
/// - The owner can `cancel`, in which case participants must be refunded.
/// - If the owner does not end the game via `chooseWinner` within 24 hours after PARTICIPATION `state` ended, then anyone can `cancel`.
/// - The contract has no `kill` function which would allow the owner to run off with the pot.
/// - Game parameters cannot be changed when a game is ongoing
/// - Logging of relevant events to increase transparency
