 * @title CCCosmos SAT
 *  
 * The only official website: https://cccosmos.com
 * 
 *     CCCosmos is a game Dapp that runs on Ethereum. The mode of smart contract makes it run in a decentralized way. 
 * Code logic prevents any others' control and keep the game fun, fair, and feasible. Unlike most DApps that require a browser
 * plug-in, the well-designed CCCosmos can easily help you win great bonuses via any decentralized Ethereum wallet 
 * on your phone.
 *   
 *                                        ///Game Description///
 * # The first-time user can activate his/her Ethereum address by just paying an amount more than 0.01eth.
 * 
 * # The contract will automatically calculate the user's SAT account according to the price, and may immediately 
 * receive up to seven-fold rewards.
 * 
 * # Holding SAT brings users continuous earnings; if you are the last one to get SAT at the end of the game, you 
 * will win the huge sum in the final pot!
 * 
 * # Final Prize
 * As the game countdown ends, the last SAT buyer will win the Final Pot.
 * 
 * # Early Birds
 * Whenever a player buys SAT, the SAT price goes up; the early birds would get rich earnings.
 * 
 * # Late Surprise
 * SAT buyers will have the chance to win multiplied rewards in betting; later users may win more eths.
 * 
 * # Be Dealers
 * The top three users holding the most SATs are dealers who will continuously receive dealer funds for the day.
 * 
 * # Happy Ending
 * After the game is over, all users will divide up the whole prize pot to win bonuses, and then a new round of 
 * game starts.
 * 
 *                                              ///Rules///
 * 1. The countdown to the end is initially set to be 24 hours. Whenever a user buys a SAT, the remaining time will 
 * be extended by 30 seconds; but the total extension will not exceed 24 hours.
 * 
 * 2. Any amount of eth a user transfers to the contract address, with 0.01 eth deducted for activation fee, can be 
 * used to buy SAT. The remaining sum of SAT can be checked in any Ethereum wallet.
 * 
 * 3. The initial SAT price is 0.000088eth, and the price will increase by 0.000000002eth for every SAT purchased.
 * 
 * 4. All eths the users spent on SAT are put into the prize pot, 50% of which enters the Share Pot, 20% the Final 
 * Pot, 25.5% the Lucky Pot, and the rest 4.5% the Dealer Pot.
 * 
 * 5. When users transfer a certain amount of SAT to the contract address, the corresponding response function 
 * will be triggered and then the transferred SAT will be refunded in full.
 * 
 *    # To get all the eth gains earned at your address by transferring back 0.08 SAT.
 * 
 *    # To make an instant re-investment and buy SAT with all eth gains earned at your address by transferring 
 *      back 0.01 SAT.
 * 
 *    # After the game is over, you can get all the eth gains earned at your address by transferring back any 
 *      amount of SAT.
 * 
 *    # The average withdrawal rate is less than 7.5% and decreases as the total SAT issuance increases. When the 
 *      SAT price reaches 0.1eth, zero-fee is charged!
 * 
 * 6. Users have a 50% chance to get instant rewards in different proportions, maximally seven-fold, after they buy 
 * SAT immediately.! (The maximum amount of the rewards cannot exceed 1/2 of the current lucky pot.)
 * 
 *                             Probability of Winning Rewards
 * 
 *                          Reward ratio           probability
 *                               10%                   30%
 *                               20%                   10%
 *                               50%                   5%
 *                               100%                  3%
 *                               300%                  2%
 *                               700%                  1%
 * 
 * 7. Users can log into cccosmos.com to check the earnings and get other detailed information.
 * 
 * 8. The top three Ethereum addresses with the most SAT purchase for the day will divide up the present Dealer 
 *    Fund!
 * 
 * 9. One month after the game ends, the unclaimed eths will be automatically transferred to the CCCosmos 
 *    Developer Fund for subsequent development and services.
