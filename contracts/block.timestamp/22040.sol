// welcome to EtherWild (EthWild)
// game which is a simple coin toss game, you have 50% chance to win.
// you always play against someone else. 
// there are two ways to play; the auto-way by just placing a bet (only one allowed)
// this is the standard way to play 
// if you place this bet and another one places the same bet, a match occurs and a game is played 
// Note: you are allowed to withdraw these bets. If all offers are cancelled 0 eth is in contract. 

// Offers: 
// You are allowed to create 16 offers in the game. Other people can find these offers and play with them
// This is doable if you do not like the suggested offers, or simply want to put on more games. 
// These are also cancellable. 
// If you play someone's offer and send to much, excess is returned.
