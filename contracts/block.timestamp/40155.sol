/**
 * Author: Nick Johnson <arachnid at notdot.net>
 * 
 * WARNING: This contract is new and thus-far only lightly tested. I'm fairly
 * confident it operates as described, but you may want to assure yourself of
 * its correctness - or wait for others to do so for you - before you trust your
 * ether to it. No guarantees, express or implied, are provided - use at your
 * own risk.
 * 
 * @dev Ether vault contract. Stores ether with a 'time lock' on withdrawals,
 *      giving a user the chance to reclaim funds if an account is compromised.
 *      A recovery address has the ability to immediately destroy the wallet and
 *      send its funds to a new contract (such as a new vault, if the wallet)
 *      associated with this one is compromised or lost). A cold wallet or
 *      secure brain wallet should typically be used for this purpose.
 * 
 * Setup:
 *   To set up a vault, first create a cold wallet or secure brain wallet to use
 *   as a recovery key, and get its address. Then, deploy this vault contract
 *   with the address of the recovery key, and a time delay (in seconds) to
 *   impose on withdrawals.
 * 
 * Deposits:
 *   Simply deposit funds into this contract by sending them to them. This
 *   contract only uses the minimum gas stipend, so it's safe to use with
 *   sites that "don't support smart contracts".
 * 
 * Withdrawals:
 *   Call unvault() with the amount you wish to withdraw (in wei - one ether is
 *   1e18 wei). After the time delay you specified when you created the wallet,
 *   you can call withdraw() to receive the funds.
 * 
 * Vacations:
 *   If you anticipate not having access to the recovery key for some period,
 *   you can call `lock()` with a period (in seconds) that the funds should be
 *   unavailable for; this will prohibit any withdrawals completing during that
 *   period. If a withdrawal is outstanding, it will be postponed until the
 *   end of this period, too.
 * 
 * Recovery:
 *   If your hotwallet is every compromised, or you detect an unauthorized
 *   `Unvault()` event, use your recovery key to call the `recover()` function
 *   with the address you want funds sent to. The funds will be immediately
 *   sent to this address (with no delay) and the contract will self destruct.
 * 
 *   For safety, you may wish to prepare a new vault (with a new recovery key)
 *   and send your funds directly to that.
