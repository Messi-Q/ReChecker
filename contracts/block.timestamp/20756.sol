		//		maximum amount of investments allowed will be raised over time. This will allow for higher bets by gamblers, resulting
		// 		in higher dividends for the bankrollers
		// 3. The owner can freeze payouts to bettors. This will be used in case of an emergency, and the contract will reject all
		//		new bets as well. This does not mean that bettors will lose their money without recompense. They will be allowed to call the 
		// 		"refund" function in the respective game smart contract once payouts are un-frozen.
		// 4. Finally, the owner can modify and withdraw the developers reward, which will fund future development, including new games, a sexier frontend,
		// 		and TRUE DAO governance so that onlyOwner functions don't have to exist anymore ;) and in order to effectively react to changes 
		// 		in the market (lower the percentage because of increased competition in the blockchain casino space, etc.)
