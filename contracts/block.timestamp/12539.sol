/*
 * Contract accepting reservations for ATS tokens.
 * The actual tokens are not yet created and distributed due to non-technical reasons.
 * This contract is used to collect funds for the ATS token sale and to transparently document that on a blockchain.
 * It is tailored to allow a simple user journey while keeping complexity minimal.
 * Once the privileged "state controller" sets the state to "Open", anybody can send Ether to the contract.
 * Only Ether sent from whitelisted addresses is accepted for future ATS token conversion.
 * The whitelisting is done by a dedicated whitelist controller.
 * Whitelisting can take place asynchronously - that is, participants don't need to wait for the whitelisting to
 * succeed before sending funds. This is a technical detail which allows for a smoother user journey.
 * The state controller can switch to synchronous whitelisting (no Ether accepted from accounts not whitelisted before).
 * Participants can trigger refunding during the Open state by making a transfer of 0 Ether.
 * Funds of those not whitelisted (not accepted) are never locked, they can trigger refund beyond Open state.
 * Only in Over state can whitelisted Ether deposits be fetched from the contract.
 *
 * When setting the state to Open, the state controller specifies a minimal timeframe for this state.
 * Transition to the next state (Locked) is not possible (enforced by the contract).
 * This gives participants the guarantee that they can get their full deposits refunded anytime and independently
 * of the will of anybody else during that timeframe.
 * (Note that this is true only as long as the whole process takes place before the date specified by FALLBACK_FETCH_FUNDS_TS)
 *
 * Ideally, there's no funds left in the contract once the state is set to Over and the accepted deposits were fetched.
 * Since this can't really be foreseen, there's a fallback which allows to fetch all remaining Ether
 * to a pre-specified address after a pre-specified date.
 *
 * Static analysis: block.timestamp is not used in a way which gives miners leeway for taking advantage.
 *
 * see https://code.lab10.io/graz/04-artis/artis/issues/364 for task evolution
