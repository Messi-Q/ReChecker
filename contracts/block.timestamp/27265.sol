- LifetimeLottery
 
    - 0.005 ETH buy in, 0.002 of that goes to jackpot pool
    - 2% chance of winning jackpot
 
    - When you send 0.005 ETH to the contract, it adds your address to the lottery list. After that, the following results are possible:
        - Your address is the winner and you receive 0.003 ETH. The contract hits the jackpot and you receive the whole jackpot too.
        - Your address is the winner and you receive 0.003 ETH. The jackpot increases by 0.002 ETH.
        - Any other address from the list is the winner and receives 0.003 ETH. The contract hits the jackpot and sends it to the winning address too.
        - Any other address from the list is the winner and receives 0.003 ETH. The jackpot increases by 0.002 ETH
