This package is a python implementation of smart contract vulnerability detection based on deep learning. In previous studies, [VulDeePecker](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01681) is a design and implementation of a deep learning-based vulnerability detection system. Moreover, they present the first vulnerability dataset for deep learning approaches.  The datasets of [CWE-119](https://github.com/CGCL-codes/VulDeePecker/tree/master/CWE-119) and [CWE-399](https://github.com/CGCL-codes/VulDeePecker/tree/master/CWE-399) can be obtained [here](https://github.com/CGCL-codes/VulDeePecker). In our study, we refer to the idea of VulDeePecker to apply deep learning to smart contract vulnerability detection. As a contribution, we offer the trainable smart contract dataset under the folder where the file name is data. It needs to be pointed out that at present we only detect the smart contract reentrancy vulnerability.

### Required Dataset
This repository contains the smart contract dataset of source code and processed code fragment. As to the source code, we crawled the source code of the smart contract from the [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/) by using the crawler tool. Besides, we have collected some data from some other websites. At the same time, we also designed and wrote some smart contract codes with reentrancy vulnerabilities. 

**Note:** crawler tool is available [here](https://github.com/Messi-Q/Crawler).

### Dataset
Original Ethereum smart contracts:  [Etherscan_contract](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h9aFFSsL7mK4NmVJd4So7IJlFj9u0HRv)

The train data after normalization in `train_data`.

## Overview

My attempt to detect smart contract reentrancy vulnerability. We apply deep learning to smart contract vulnerability detection.
So far, we have completed the following work:
* Uses N-grams and deep learning network to train detection model, include GRU, LSTM, BLSTM, and LSTM-Attention.
* Implemented a tool to automatically construct smart contract code fragments.
  * Find the semantic-related code with the key function call.value.
  * Code gadgets are vectorized for input to neural network.
* Trained in the reentrancy vulnerability to detect exploitable code in solidity.
* Provides the trainable smart contract code fragment dataset.

### Reentrancy
**Reentrancy vulnerability** 

When an attacker initiates a transfer operation to a contract address, it will force the execution of the fallback function of the attack contract itself. The fallback function then contains the callback's code, which causes the code to "re-enter" the contract.

**Smart contract fallback function**  
* If a contract is called, there is no match for any of the functions. Then, the default fallback function is called.
* This function is also executed when a contract receives ether (without any other data).

At present, the attacker mainly implements reentrancy through the characteristics of the Ethereum smart contract call.value function. Its characteristics include:
* When the execution fails, all the gas is consumed.
* It cannot safely prevent reentry attacks.

Reentrancy vulnerabilities have led to the loss of millions of dollars in The DAO attacks, which eventually leads to the hard fork of Ethereum.

The following is an example of a smart contract reentrancy:

<div align=center><img width="500" height="200" src="./figs/reentrancy_example.png"/></div>

This attack can occur when a contract sends an Ether to an unknown address. An attacker can build a contract at an external address that contains malicious code in the fallback function. Therefore, when the contract sends the Ether to this address, the malicious code will be activated.

Therefore, in the current severe security contract vulnerability, an effective smart contract vulnerability detection tool is urgently needed to detect contract-related vulnerabilities. It is very necessary and useful to design and implement a smart contract security vulnerability detection device. 


### Data
Code Fragment focuses on the reentrancy vulnerabilities in the smart contract(solidity programs). In total, the Code Fragment database contains 1671 code fragments, including 197 vulnerable code gadgets and 1273 code gadgets that are not vulnerable. Due to the limited number of smart contracts on Ethereum, we reused some smart contracts.

#### How to construct the code fragment?
* Remove all comments from the solidity source code. Remove comment tool available [here](https://github.com/Messi-Q/Automation-Tools/blob/master/delete_comment_official.py)
* Find the function where call.value is in the contract and the superior function that called the function.
* Assemble the functions found into a code fragment of a smart contract.

### Models
In our experiment, all hyperparameters are the same for the baseline LSTM, GRU, BLSTM, and BLSTM+Attention, which hyperparameters from `parser.py` are used.

Implementation is very basic without many optimizations, so that it is easier to debug and play around with the code.
```shell
python SmConVulDetector.py --model LSTM_Model  # to run LSTM
python SmConVulDetector.py --model GRU_Model  # to run GRU
python SmConVulDetector.py --model BLSTM  # to run BLSTM
python SmConVulDetector.py --model BLSTM_Attention # to run BLSTM with Attention
```

### Code Files

1. `SmConVulDetector.py`
* Interface to project, uses functionality from other code files.
* Fetches each gadget, cleans, buffers, trains Word2Vec model, vectorizes, passes to neural net.
2. `clean_fragment.py`
* For each gadget, replaces all user variables with "VAR#" and user functions with "FUN#".
* Removes content from string and character literals.
3. `vectorize_fragment.py`
* Converts gadgets into vectors.
* Tokenizes gadget (converts to symbols, operators, keywords).
* Uses Word2Vec to convert tokens to embeddings.
* Combines token embeddings in a gadget to create 2D gadget vector.
4. `AutoExtractCode.py`
* All functions in the smart contract code are automatically split and stored.
* Find the function where call.value is located and the superior function that called the function.
* Assemble the functions found into a code fragment of a smart contract.

**Note:** If you use the automation tool for generating code fragment, you need to normalize your smart contract code. Such as:
1. The function name, parameters, and return value are on one line.
```shell
 function div(uint256 _a, uint256 _b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
```
2. Remove irrelevant information from the contract, such as comments.
3. There are a few empty lines as possible between statements, and it is best to stick them between statements.
bad example:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint _value, 
         bytes _data, string _custom_fallback) 
         public returns (bool success) {
         
        require(_value > 0 && frozenAccount[msg.sender] == false 
        && frozenAccount[_to] == false 
        && now > unlockUnixTime[msg.sender] 
        && now > unlockUnixTime[_to]);

        if (isContract(_to)) {
        
            require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
            balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value);
            
            
            
            balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to].add(_value);
            assert(_to.call.value(0)(bytes4(keccak256(_custom_fallback)), msg.sender, _value, _data));
            Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value, _data);
            
            
            
            Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
            return true;
            
        } else {
        
            return transferToAddress(_to, _value, _data);
        }
    }
```

good example:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data, string _custom_fallback) public returns (bool success) {
        require(_value > 0 && frozenAccount[msg.sender] == false && frozenAccount[_to] == false && now > unlockUnixTime[msg.sender] && now > unlockUnixTime[_to]);

        if (isContract(_to)) {
            require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
            balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value);
            balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to].add(_value);
            assert(_to.call.value(0)(bytes4(keccak256(_custom_fallback)), msg.sender, _value, _data));
            Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value, _data);
            Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
            return true;
        } else {
            return transferToAddress(_to, _value, _data);
        }
    }
```

### Running project
* To run program, use this command: python SmConVulDetector.py --dataset [code_fragment_file], where code_fragment_file is one of the text files containing a fragment set.
* Also, you can use specific hyperparameters to train the model. All the hyperparameters can be found in `parser.py`.

Examples:
```shell
python SmConVulDetector.py --dataset train_data/reentrancy_1671.txt
python SmConVulDetector.py --dataset train_data/reentrancy_1671.txt --model BLSTM --lr 0.002 --dropout 0.5 --vector_dim 100 --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

Using scriptï¼š
Repeating 10 times with `train.sh`.
```shell
for i in $(seq 1 10); do python SmConVulDetector.py | tee evaluations/logs/blstm_att/smartcheck_"$i".log;; done
./train.sh
```
Then, you can find the training results in the `evaluations/logs`.
